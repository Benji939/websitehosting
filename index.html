         <h2>Why This Hobby?</h2>
         <hr>
        <p> I enjoy solving them because, how could something so simple be so complicated? It's also very satisfying just putting all the colors in the correct spot, it's like the need for order. There are many variants of it, ones with more or less layers and some even with different shaps or different ways to turn. It so satisfying being your previous best time. Some may they think it will get old solving  it over and over again may get boring and old, for me it never does because there are more than 43 quintillion combinations and only one solution. </p>
